        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Life</h3>
        <p>On any given day you can find me working, playing video games, running, and more. I dont really have a plan going through life, I prefer to wing it alot instead. Not bragging too much though cause it has come back to bite me a couple of times. </p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>My educational journey has been far from average as i went from being an AP student with high college prospects back in highschool to now after i dropped out of university, fumbled around in community college, and learned about fullstack academy.</p>
